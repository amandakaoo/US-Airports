# Airports in the United States

The map contains all the airports in the United States. It is a choropleth map based on the number of airports within each state, showing airport density and indicating whether the airport has an air traffic control tower or not.

### Description

This is a choropleth map of airport density by "State" in the United States. The icon of the "plane" symbol color shows whether or not the airport has an air traffic control tower located. The plane symbol color in *green* indicates the airport has an air traffic tower; The plane symbol color in *orange* indicates the airport has no air traffic tower. Also, the name of specific airports will pop-up once the users click on an individual "plane" icon.

### Methods

Since there are so many airports in the United States. I want to modify my map more use friendly and geared toward the information once users first enter the web page. Instead of showing the US as a whole, I set the map's zoom level and center position more focused on the contiguous United States and part of Alaska. We can see geocoded locations where airports are located, and the distribution of the airports tells us whether individual has an air traffic tower or not. When users zoom out the map, they can still easily access the information on the Unites States of America that including the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and other territories under the control of the US.

From the map, it seems like the Contiguous United States has a relatively higher portion of airports that have air traffic towers. The East part of the US has more airports and has a higher percentage of air traffic tower than the West part. On the other hand, Alaska has many airports on the land but only a few of it has an air traffic tower located at the airport.
